  Scrape all class that is currently offered at Berkeley from http://guide.berkeley.edu/courses/:
  create a huge CSV for every class with useful information:
  depart:   string,         the department this class is in.          "MATH"
  name:     string,         name of the class.                        "Multivariable Calculus"
  prereq:   string,         prereq of the class                       "Mathematics 1B"
  number:   string,         number of the class                       "53"
  units:    Integer,        number of units                           4
  descrip   string,         course description                        "Parametric equations and polar coordinates. Vectors in 2- and 3-dimensional Euclidean spaces. Partial derivatives. Multiple integrals. Vector calculus. Theorems of Green, Gauss, and Stokes. "

2.
  Process the CSV:
  isAC:     boolean,        if it satisfy AC requirement              False
  isRCA:    boolean,        if it satisfy first half R&C              False
  isRCB:    boolean,        if it satisfy second half R&C             False

3.
  Merge the CSV with the Breath Requirements:
  breath_1: boolean,        if it satisfy Arts and Literature
  breath_2: boolean,        Biological Science
  breath_3: boolean,        Historical Studies
  breath_4: boolean,        International Studies
  breath_5: boolean,        Philosophy and Values
  breath_6: boolean,        Physical Science
